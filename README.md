# solomontaiwo.github.io

This is my personal portfolio website built using React. It serves as a space to share some basic information about myself, including my educational background, current studies and professional experiences, as well as a showcase for some of the projects I've worked on.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
